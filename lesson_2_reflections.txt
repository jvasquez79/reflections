What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created with metadata about the repository. Necessary so that git starts tracking changes on files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
In a working directory I can have files I'm not interested in keeping track of.
