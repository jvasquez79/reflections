When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When having other people contributing to a project
-When working with more than one computer
-As a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So I don't lose changes I've made manually until I'm ready to pull the latest version

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used to copy repositories from github into my own and make changes without the intention of changing the original repository.
Clones are used to copy locally a repository to make changes, and eventually push changes into the origin.
Branches are used to make changes to a repository without forcing others to use my changes before they're tested.
