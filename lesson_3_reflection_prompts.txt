When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When having other people contributing to a project
-When working with more than one computer
-As a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So I don't lose changes I've made manually until I'm ready to pull the latest version
