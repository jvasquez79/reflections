How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
I didn't need to compare both files line by line since the diff tool pointed out the actual differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would make it easier to find errors as I compare the latest version to a previous working one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: Commits are about logical changes.
Cons: I could forget to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is meant to work with multiple files with dependencies.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lets you see the commit history of a file.
git diff lets you compare two specific versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If I break something, I could always go back to a previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
